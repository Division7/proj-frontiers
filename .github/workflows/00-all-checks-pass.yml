name: 00 - All Checks Pass

# This workflow checks if all required checks have passed before allowing a pull request to be merged.
# It is triggered on pull request events and uses the GitHub CLI to check the status of checks.
# The workflow will wait for all other checks to finish before proceeding.
# If any of the required checks fail, the workflow will exit with an error.


# This workflow updates the open PRs in
# _config.yml each time a pull request is made
# or there is a push to main.  It does not handle
# the rebuild of the storybook or javadoc; that's handled
# separately based on which files were modified.
